Ancient Greece:
===============

Temples:
--------

* Stylobate (foundation platform, can be accessed via a staircase) [done]
* Altar (outside, place for a fire)[done]
* Tiled roofs, either s-shaped or two interlocking shapes. [done]
* Inner doors have wooden frames, outer doors ave stone ones.[done]


### Doric:
* Doric column: No base, around 4-8 diameters high, 20 flutes, capital is simple: a circular band that morphs into a rectangular band(abacus). [done]
* Doric architrave+frieze: Triglyphs(square with three bands) and metopes(open rectangular space) alternate on the frieze, frieze and architrave are about the same height. The metopes on the frieze may be decorated with paintings or reliefs. [done]

### Ionic

* Ionic column: circular base, capital has spirals at the corners. [done]
* Ionic Architrace+Frieze: There doesn't seem to be a specific requirement for these, so I've just added one based on the drawing on wikipedia.[done]

### Corithian:

* Corinthian column: Notable for it's flowers around the capital. circular bands around the base. [done]
* Corithian architrave+frieze: Same problem as the ionic one, so I based this one on the photo of the library of hadrian. A bit of variation is nice anyway. [done] 
Public:
-------

### Marketplace (Agora):

* Stoa(arcades) surrounded Agoras, and usually were filled with merchants selling wares.

### Public Theatre:

* Podium
* Semi-circular Benches(aaaargh)

Domestic:
---------

### Lowerclass:
* Adobe brickwork and wood structures covered with plaster[done]
* Thatch roofs.[done]
* Mostly two-room houses: The behind one is a closed room, and the front one only has three walls.[done]

### Upperclass:

* Tiled roofs, baked from clay.[done]
* Mosaiques on the floor. I made meander patterns and a couple of greek-ish items, like grapes, helmets and theseus beating up the minotaur[done]

Generally... Ancient Greek pottery is versatile but not very big. Not very surprising o course considering it's a Bronze Age society.
